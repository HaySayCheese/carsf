# Key Principles

1. **Human-in-the-Loop:** The operator is the central figure who makes decisions, provides context, and verifies results. AI agents act as powerful assistants, analysts, and "sparring partners."
   
2. **AI Diversification:** Using different models (with various strengths: analysis, creativity, critical thinking, data processing) to obtain diverse perspectives and avoid the "confirmation bubble" of a single model.

3. **Iterativity and Validation:** The process is cyclical, with constant verification, refinement, and consensus at key stages.

4. **Structure:** Clear steps and expected results at each stage.

5. **Quantitative Assessment:** Attempting to use numbers and metrics where possible and appropriate.
   
6. **Contextualization:** The quality of results depends on the *completeness of context provided by the operator*.

# Important Aspects

- **Adaptability:** This framework is a template. The operator should adapt steps, prompts, and level of detail to the specific task, available AI, and time constraints. Some steps can be combined or skipped if appropriate.
    
- **Prompt Engineering:** The quality of results strongly depends on the clarity and specificity of prompts. The operator may need to experiment with formulations.
    
- **Interaction Management:** Working with multiple AIs requires attention to process organization: collecting responses, synthesizing them, eliminating duplication, transferring relevant dialogue history. Specialized tools or platforms may be useful.
    
- **Handling Disagreements:** When AIs give contradictory answers or assessments, this is a valuable signal. The operator should investigate the causes of discrepancies (different data? different interpretations? logical errors?), possibly through additional queries to the AI, before making decisions.

# Preparation

1. [ ] Choose AI models that will participate in the consortium
   - Ideally, the models should meet the following requirements:
     1. Access to current Internet data
     2. Reasoning capability
       
   - Recommended models (as of 04.2025):
     - `Gemini 2.5 pro`
     - `Claude 3.7 sonnet (thinking)`
     - `Grok3 thinking / research`
     - `Deep Seek r1`
     - `Open AI O3 + deep research`

# Phase 4: In-depth Research and Hypothesis Validation (Iterative Cycle)

*For each selected hypothesis, the following steps are performed:*

## 4.1: Hypothesis Decomposition and Verification Planning
    
- [ ] **Operator:** Asks AI to plan verification of a specific hypothesis.
    
- **Prompt (to all AI):**
    
```
We are considering the hypothesis: 

{{Hypothesis Text}}

Applying the **analytical perspective**, determine:
1.  Key assumptions underlying this hypothesis.
2.  What specific data, evidence, or experiments are needed to confirm or refute it? Indicate desired quantitative indicators.
3.  Which methods of analysis (comparison, statistical test, search for counterexamples, modeling, etc.) are most appropriate?
4.  What additional sources of information should be involved (if needed)?
Propose a specific action plan for verifying this hypothesis.
```
    
- **Expected Result:** Plan for hypothesis verification. The operator agrees on the final plan.
    
## 4.2: Targeted Collection of Additional Information / Conducting Analysis
    
- [ ] **Operator (and/or AI as directed):** Executes the plan from Step 4.1 – searches for specific data, conducts necessary calculations, analyses, or modeling (if possible for AI).
    
- **Expected Result:** New data/analysis results relevant to hypothesis verification.
    
## 4.3: Analysis and Interpretation of Data Regarding the Hypothesis
    
- [ ] **Operator:** Provides collected data/results to AI.
    
- **Prompt (to one or several AI – for initial analysis):**
    
```
Here are the data/analysis results collected to verify the hypothesis "[Hypothesis Text]": [Link/description/data]. Applying the **analytical perspective**, analyze these results.
*   To what extent do the data confirm or refute the hypothesis?
*   Present the results of the analysis, preferably with quantitative assessments (e.g., degree of correlation, statistical significance, range of values, percentage of cases).
*   Indicate possible limitations of this analysis or data quality.
Make a preliminary conclusion about the status of the hypothesis.
```
    
- **Expected Result:** Initial analysis and interpretation of data regarding the hypothesis.
    
## 4.4: Cross-validation and Search for Consensus/Divergences
    
- [ ] **Operator:** Asks other AIs (or all) to conduct a critical assessment of the initial analysis.
    
- **Prompt (to AIs who did NOT do the initial analysis, or to all):**
    
```
Review the analysis of the hypothesis 

"{{Hypothesis Text}}" provided by {{specify who, or reference to Step 4.3 analysis}}. 

Applying the **critical perspective**:
*   Do you agree with the conclusions? Why or why not?
*   Are there alternative interpretations of the same data?
*   Do you see any logical fallacies, insufficiently substantiated claims, or potential biases in the analysis?
*   Were the limitations mentioned in the previous step adequately addressed?

Now, applying the **synthesizing perspective**, attempt to formulate a consortium-wide position on this hypothesis. If there is no consensus, clearly articulate the points of disagreement and arguments from each side. Assess the overall confidence level (e.g., on a scale from 0 to 1, or in words: low/medium/high) in the conclusions regarding this hypothesis.
```
    
- **Expected Result:** Critical reviews, identification of consensus or divergences, assessment of confidence level.
    
## 4.5: Decision on Hypothesis and Next Steps
    
- [ ] **Operator:** Analyzes the results of analysis and cross-validation. Makes a decision: hypothesis confirmed (with certain level of confidence), refuted, needs modification, or further research is required.
    
- **Actions:** Move to the next hypothesis or, if all hypotheses have been verified, proceed to Phase 5. If further research is needed, return to Step 4.1 or even earlier.
    
- **Expected Result:** Clear status for each priority hypothesis.

- **Prompt (to one AI with focus on synthesis):**
    
```
Using the **synthesizing perspective**, gather and structure conclusions about all verified hypotheses (considering their status and confidence level). Show how these conclusions together address the key research questions (KRQs) and overall research goal defined in the plan. Try to visualize (textually or conceptually) the main findings and connections between them.
```

- **Prompt (to other AIs - for review):**

```
Using the **critical perspective**, review the synthesis provided:
1. Are all hypotheses adequately addressed?
2. Is the connection to KRQs and research goals clear and logical?
3. Are there any gaps, inconsistencies, or overstatements?
4. Suggest improvements to make conclusions more robust and actionable.
```
